# Implementation of Algorithms for the Measure of Inequality on Partially ordered data

This repository contains the practical work behindd my very theoretical Bachelor thesis.

## Goals ðŸŽ¯

The thesis dealt with *partially ordered sets* and their implementation in R.
In particular, the implementation of Markov Chain methods for the computation of inequality measures on *linear extensions* of the poset.
After reading literature and a lot of theoretical work, the Bubley-Dier method was chosen [[1]](#1).
Refer to [the thesis](https://github.com/rmaganza/parsec-improved/blob/master/thesis/tesi_RiccardoMaganza.pdf) (in italian) for a lot more in-depth explanations.

## Tools ðŸ› 

The work started from [the *parsec* package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/parsec/index.html) which I shamelessly bumped in the *parsec_source* directory. (I'm sure my advisor won't mind).
The packaged was then extended with new-low level C functions allowing for fast generation of linear extensions and computing of inequality measures, and a couple of new R functions to interface the C level.

In particular, to implement the proposed algorithm [the *ransampl* library](https://jugit.fz-juelich.de/mlz/ransampl) was used to randomly generate numbers from a specific discrete distribution. I also included the library here with the appropriate license statements.
